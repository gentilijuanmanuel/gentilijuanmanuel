### Hi there 👋

- 👨‍💻 I'm a software engineer from 🇦🇷, mainly focused on development for Apple platforms.
- 💼 I’m working as an Mobile/watchOS Engineer at [Runna](https://www.runna.com/).
- 🎓 I graduated from the National Technological University (Rosario, Argentina).
- 🌱 I'm passionate about Swift and development for Apple platforms. On the other hand, working for a high-impact product is something very important to me, because it allows me to clearly see that my day-to-day work translates into meeting people’s needs and changing lives. I’m quite interested in topics such as fintech, democratization of finance, crypto/web3, environment, physical and mental health, productivity, reading, fitness, UX/UI, science and more. I try to apply my technical knowledge on full-time, freelancer jobs and open-source contributions that are aligned with those interests.
